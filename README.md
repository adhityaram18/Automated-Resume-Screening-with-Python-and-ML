# Automated Resume Screening with Python and ML

An advanced machine learning application designed to automate and enhance the resume screening process, making recruitment more efficient and effective.

## Overview

The Automated Resume Screening tool leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to categorize resumes, extract vital information, and match candidates with suitable job openings. This project aims to streamline the recruitment process by reducing manual effort and mitigating human bias in resume screening.

## Key Features

1. **Resume Parsing**: Utilizes NLP to extract essential details such as contact information, skills, education, and work experience from resumes.
2. **Categorization**: Applies machine learning algorithms to categorize resumes based on predefined criteria set by recruiters.
3. **Job Recommendations**: Provides personalized job recommendations to match candidates with the most suitable job openings.
